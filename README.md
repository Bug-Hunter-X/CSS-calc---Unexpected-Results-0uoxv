This repository demonstrates a common issue with the CSS `calc()` function: unexpected results due to incorrect spacing or inconsistent units. The `bug.css` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises from inconsistencies in how browsers parse the `calc()` function's arguments.  Incorrect spacing can lead to parsing errors and unexpected results.  Inconsistent units can also produce unexpected outputs.
