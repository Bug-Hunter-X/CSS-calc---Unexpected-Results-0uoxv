The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes it can lead to unexpected results if there are spaces within the calculation or if the units are inconsistent. For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px)` is correct, but `width: calc( 100% - 20px )` with spaces around the operators might not work as expected in some browsers. Similarly, using mixed units like `width: calc(100px - 20%)` can cause issues. Also, be sure to handle cases where the calculation might result in a negative value.
